## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Bootstrap framework
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project was very helpful as it served as a reminder of some CSS styling attributes. As a backend developer I'd lost track of many things i used to know in CSS and this was a really nice recap.



### Continued development

I would really like to refine my use of Flexbox. I've noticed that it is a really useful tool to have in my front-end toolbox as it solved one major problem i encountered while completing this project. So I would like to learn how to use it better
